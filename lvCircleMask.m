% This function detects the left-ventricle (LV) cavity by approximating it
% as a circle in a binary image. It uses imfindcircles to search for bright,
% circular structures within a given radius range, then selects the
% circle whose center is closest to the right. Finally, it
% returns a filled binary mask corresponding to the selected circle, along
% with its center, radius, and metric.
